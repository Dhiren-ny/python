#  Enumerate Function
#  ======================
#  Enumerate is a built-in Python function that adds a counter to an iterable and returns it
# #  in a form of enumerate object. This is useful when you need to keep track of the
# e.g
#  index of each item in a list or other iterable
#  Enumerate is often used in loops to get both the index and the value of each item

# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
# #  Use enumerate to get both the index and the value of each fruit
# for ok, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
#   print(f"Index: {ok}, Fruit: {fruit}")

#  we will get index by using enumerate function


# names={"dhiren","adarsh","shital","shiruti"}
# for i,name in enumerate(names):
#   print(f"Index: {i}, Name: {name}")
